# DieDieImmaDebaiSin
## Introduction
This project has the goal to better understand webdevelopment, back/front-end-devleopment and to expand our programming skills. Our top maxim is to work as modern and efficient as possible, so we want to derive and experience best practices during this project. In addition, we want to program a first simple website, which is the central feature for our group of friends "Die Die Imma Debai Sin".
